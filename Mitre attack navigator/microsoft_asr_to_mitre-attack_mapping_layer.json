			"comment": "\n\nMitigates > \n\nName: Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)\n\nThis rule helps prevent credential stealing by locking down Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).\nLSASS authenticates users who sign in on a Windows computer. Microsoft Defender Credential Guard in Windows normally prevents attempts to extract credentials from LSASS. Some organizations can't enable Credential Guard on all of their computers because of compatibility issues with custom smartcard drivers or other programs that load into the Local Security Authority (LSA). In these cases, attackers can use tools like Mimikatz to scrape cleartext passwords and NTLM hashes from LSASS.\nBy default the state of this rule is set to block. In most cases, many processes make calls to LSASS for access rights that are not needed. For example, such as when the initial block from the ASR rule results in a subsequent call for a lesser privilege which subsequently succeeds. For information about the types of rights that are typically requested in process calls to LSASS, see: Process Security and Access Rights.\nEnabling this rule doesn't provide additional protection if you have LSA protection enabled since the ASR rule and LSA protection work similarly. However, when LSA protection cannot be enabled, this rule can be configured to provide equivalent protection against malware that target lsass.exe.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem",

These files are either duplicates or impostors of the original system tools.\nSome malicious programs may try to copy or impersonate Windows system tools to avoid detection or gain privileges. Allowing such executable files can lead to potential attacks. This rule prevents propagation and execution of such duplicates and impostors of the system tools on Windows machines.\nNote:\nThis capability is currently in preview.

It uses both client and cloud heuristics to determine whether a file resembles ransomware.
